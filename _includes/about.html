                <p>I am currently a senior slated to graduate with a bachelorâ€™s in computer science in December 2020, 
                        from the school of Bourns College Of Engineering at the University Of California, Riverside. 
                        Having worked as a systems administrator for over 10 years, my past work experience has allowed 
                        me to see the front and back-end interrelations between software engineering and the operations 
                        of computer systems, which in term have demonstrated the interconnections of the engineering process and the 
                        end-user. My studies have led me to focus in certain subjects with in the software engineering scope 
                        AI, machine learning, and Natural Language Processing.</p>
                

                <p>I am currently seeking new opportunities to further expand my knowledge.</p>
