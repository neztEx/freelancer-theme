description: The Pacman map is divided into two halves blue (right) and red (left). Red agents (which all have even indices) must defend the red food while trying to eat the blue food. When on the red side, a red agent is a ghost. When crossing into enemy territory, the agent becomes a Pacman. The objective is to create a team of agents that are able to win matches.
